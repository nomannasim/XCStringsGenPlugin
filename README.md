## Installation

### Option 1: Integrating into your Xcode project

1. Open your project in Xcode.
2. Go to **File** → **Add Package Dependencies...**
3. Enter the package URL: https://github.com/nonasim/XCStringsGenPlugin.git
4. Set the dependency rule (e.g., **Up to Next Major Version**).
5. Click **Add Package** and select the appropriate target.
6. Add it as a Build Tool Plug-in:
    1. Select appropriate target -> Build Phases
    2. Expand **Run Build Tool Plug-ins** and use **+** button to add XCStringsGenPlugin

### Option 2: Integrating into your Swift package

1. Open `Package.swift` file
2. Add it as package dependency:
```swift
dependencies: [
 .package(url: "https://github.com/nonasim/XCStringsGenPlugin.git", from: "1.0.0"),
],
```
3. Add as build tool plugin for the target:
```swift
.target(
    name: "AppCore",
    ...
    plugins: [
        .plugin(name: "XCStringsGenPlugin", package: "XCStringsGenPlugin"),
    ]
)
```

## Usage

When building the project for the first time after adding the plugin, you may encounter a build error stating "XCStringsGenPlugin" is disabled. To proceed, click the error in the Issue Navigator, review the plugin, select "Trust & Enable," and then build again.

Once the build process is complete, you should be able to see the file path through **Report navigator** under **Run custom shell script 'XCStringsGen: Code generation'**. This tells you that the file has been generated and its attributes can be referenced from the code.

In case you want to take a look at the file, you can open it through the file path above OR you can jump to the file from any reference from code using options like **Command(⌘) + Click** since this is compiled as part of the target.

Based on the entries in your String Catalog, the plugin generates a localized `L10n` enum which you can access as follows:
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var username: String = "Alice"
    @State private var notificationCount: Int = 5
    @State private var balance: Double = 1234.56
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Welcome to the app!
            Text(L10n.welcomeMessage)
            
            // Hello, %@! We're glad to see you.
            Text(L10n.greetings(username))
            
            // You have %d new notifications.
            Text(L10n.notificationMessage(notificationCount))
            
            // %@, you have %d unread messages and your account balance is $%.2f.
            Text(L10n.summary(username, notificationCount, balance))
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

```

The plugin also supports multiple String Catalogs. If you have two or more String Catalogs then the filename is used as a namespace. This is how that looks:
```swift
Text(L10n.Onboarding.greetings(username))
Text(L10n.Settings.generalNote)
```
